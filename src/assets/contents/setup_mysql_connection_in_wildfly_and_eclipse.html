You need to <a href="http://ift.tt/2e8zdOi" target="_blank">Install JDBC Driver</a> on your Application Server, and make sure your database is up and running properly before you start.<br>
<strong>Configurations in WildFly</strong><br>
In <a href="http://ift.tt/2dUopYG">web panel</a>, go to Configuration -&gt; Subsystems -&gt; Datasources -&gt; Non-XA, and click Add. Basically, Non-XA is generally for development environment or small systems, which does not control transaction across servers. Whereas, XA will take control of transactions across servers, which is more suitable for production environment. Once you select Non-XA and click Add button, it will prompt a list of datasource types. Here I use MySQL as an example, so choose MySQL Datasource and hit next. Then give a name and JNDI name. Click on next button and it turns to JDBC Driver. Because I’ve installed/deployed MySQL Driver, I go to Detected Driver tab, and select something like this: mysql-connector-java-5.1.39-bin.jar_com.mysql.jdbc.Driver_5_1 (don’t do the Fabric one). Next, specify the connection URL, which should include your database name. Also fill out the database username and password, and leave security domain blank. Then go next and test connection. If everything goes right, it should return success. Click finish to store this datasource.<br>
<strong>Setup DB Development Connection in Eclipse</strong><br>
First, open Eclipse and switch to Database Development Perspective. In the Data Source Explorer panel, right click on Database Connection -&gt; new. Choose MySQL and hit next. Click on New Driver Definition icon and select the corresponding version of your downloaded connector JAR file. Go to JAR List tab and Clear All the Driver files. Click Add JAR/Zip and select the JAR file you downloaded. Go to Properties and specify Connection URL, Database Name, Password and User ID. Leave Driver Class as it is. Click OK. You should now see everything setup in the previous window, and click on Test Connection. If something gets wrong, compare the to the example I have here.<br>
Database:&nbsp;Your database name<br>
URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306 (by default)<br>
Username:&nbsp;database username<br>
Password:&nbsp;database password<br>
Save password: checked<br>
Click finish to store the configures. (You can hit next to review your settings, but there is nothing to change.) You will see your new database connection listed under Database Connections. Right click on it and connect to database. Database tables are listed under Connection Name/Database Name/Schemas/Database Name/Table. To run a SQL, right click on the connection name to open SQL scrapbook. In SQL Scrapbook, select connection name (database type will be auto selected once you select a name), and then select database. Then you can write and execute any SQL in this scrapbook by right click on any line of your SQL. You can execute all, or few selected lines.<br>
* I find if you use oracle database, you can integrate Beaver DB which is&nbsp;in Eclipse Marketplace&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;create tables and constraints in GUI. In my personal experience, to build a new project, I usually start with creating tables in database, then generate Entity Beans in project in the first place. But if I’m going to switch database types afterward, I just use Entity Beans to generate tables in the new database, instead of writing SQL for all the different Databases.
