Winter project is an open source project using Apache License
Version 2.0. It started in the Winter 2017, which was where its name came from.
Winter Framework intended to make life easier for Java Web Development with
Java EE environment. It helps developers to simplify common tasks such as
Security and Persistence in an efficient, easy, and best possible ways while
developing applications.<br>

The roadmap of the Winter framework includes 5 major parts:<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Winter Version Control: It can also be called Winter Parent,
which essentially a Maven POM project used as a parent project, which controls the
versions of dependencies that other Winter components use. It is important to
make sure each module uses the same versions of dependencies so that there is
no conflict between each other.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Winter Core: Winter uses CDI API (JSR 299: Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the JavaTM EE platform) as its default context and
dependency injection framework, which means it typically needs to run with an application server,
e.g. GlassFish, WildFly, etc. However, it has a light weight property file
injection component which is called Winter Core. Other Winter components depend
on it, and use it to inject properties and objects specified in the property
files.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
3. Winter Security: Winter Security is the first up and running
component has been developed for people to use. The main difference between
Java EE security framework and Winter Security is the idea behind authorization
control. Java EE security framework primarily is a role based authorization
system. Methods or APIs are assigned to roles, and users who has the roles will
be authorized. There is nothing wrong about this mechanism, but it is not
natural. In other words, system does not know the workflows. It only knows when
to let pass or stop. Winter Security marks workflow on method level. Instead of
using configurational nor programmatical ways to control the authorization
process, developers can hand out the authorization to the business side, and
let whoever knows the business to take control of it.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4. Winter Data API: Winter Data API will be the next major
component to be developed per the roadmap. Inspired by Spring Data Framework, Winter
Data API will be similar but less complex. The target is to provide an easy to
use API which wraps JPA for developers to avoid boilerplate code for common
CRUD tasks.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
5. Winter Common Utils: As in daily development, we always
have small utils that are necessary but does not come with standard libraries.
With Winter Core empowered, these utils now can be easier to use and
configurable.<o:p></o:p></div>

While I am writing this article, the current version of Winter Framework is 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT,
which means it is still under development. Even though, it is a fast-growing
project worth to give a try. Also, because it is open source, anyone can
download the code and contribute to it. This project is being managed as most
open source projects. To make your contributions, simply pick up an issue on its
GitHub repository and fix it, then make a pull request to submit your code. If
you find any bugs, you can also create an issue. If you know how to fix it, you
can fix it by yourself. Otherwise, leave the issue open to let other developers
fixing it.<o:p></o:p></div>
